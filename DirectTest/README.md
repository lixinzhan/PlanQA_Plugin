For the convenience of program testing and debugging, a seperate project is created here. If the file works well in this project, there should be no problem for PlanQA_Plugin project to work as a plugin, ideally :)

In the entry file PluginTest.cs, the patient ID, course, and plan name are to be modified manually!

Any questions are welcome!
