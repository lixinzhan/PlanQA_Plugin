This folder contains the main part of the PlanQA_Plugin script: QAProtocol.cs.

For the convenience of testing and debugging the file, a seperate project is created here. If the file works well in this project, there should be no problem in re-compiling PlanQA_Plugin project to simply use the updated QAProtocol.cs.

In the entry file EPEK.cs, patient ID, course, and plan name are to be modified manually!

Any questions are welcome!
